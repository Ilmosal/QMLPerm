File for things todo:

1. Modularize the code so that, the experimental setup is easier to create
2. Increase the amount of dataset used by the learning algorithm
    - Make sure that the algorithm is actually learning something and that the tasks are not too easy either
3. Fix the optimizing method to be the same everytime
4. Create the experimental setup interator so that the program is easily parallelizable for a super computer
5. Run the experiments
