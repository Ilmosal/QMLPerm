What changes should I do to apply this to distance matrixes with circular pattern

TODO
- Total dist to use distance matrix instead of just indices
- Do not use error as a break point as it is impossible to generate for my cases
- adjacent routine sometimes doesn't swap values
- Add minimize and maximize functions
